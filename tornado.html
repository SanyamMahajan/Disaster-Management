                    Tornadoes are violent windstorms characterized by a twisting, funnel-shaped cloud. They can cause extensive damage and pose significant risks to life and property. Tornadoes can:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop rapidly, giving little time to react.</li>
                        <li>Produce winds exceeding 300 miles per hour.</li>
                        <li>Cause destruction along their path, uprooting trees and demolishing buildings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>IF YOU ARE UNDER A TORNADO WARNING:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seek shelter immediately in a sturdy building, preferably in a basement or small, windowless interior room.</li>
                        <li>Stay away from windows and doors to avoid flying debris.</li>
                        <li>Listen to local weather updates and follow the instructions of emergency officials.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>HOW TO STAY SAFE WHEN A TORNADO THREATENS</h3>
                    <h4>Prepare NOW</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create an emergency plan that includes a designated safe location for your family during a tornado.</li>
                        <li>Prepare a disaster kit with essential supplies, including food, water, and a flashlight.</li>
                        <li>Know the signs of a tornado, such as a dark, greenish sky or a loud roar, similar to a freight train.</li>
                        <li>Sign up for local alerts and monitor weather forecasts during tornado season.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Survive DURING</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move to your designated safe area immediately when a tornado warning is issued.</li>
                        <li>If you are in a mobile home, abandon it and seek shelter in a nearby building or designated storm shelter.</li>
                        <li>Cover yourself with a mattress or heavy blankets to protect against debris.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Be Safe AFTER</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stay tuned to local news for updates on the situation and recovery efforts.</li>
                        <li>Avoid entering damaged buildings until officials have deemed them safe.</li>
                        <li>Be cautious of downed power lines and report them to the authorities.</li>
                        <li>Help neighbors and others who may need assistance.</li>
                        <li>Document any damage to your property for insurance purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
