                    An earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cause severe damage to buildings, bridges, and infrastructure.</li>
                        <li>Lead to landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction.</li>
                        <li>Occur anywhere in the world, but are most common along tectonic plate boundaries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>IF YOU ARE UNDER AN EARTHQUAKE WARNING:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drop, Cover, and Hold On! Get down on your hands and knees. Cover your head and neck with your arms or take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture. Hold On until the shaking stops.</li>
                        <li>Stay indoors if you are already inside. Move away from windows, glass, and heavy furniture that may fall.</li>
                        <li>If you are outside, move to an open area away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.</li>
                        <li>If you are in a vehicle, pull over to a clear area and stay inside with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>HOW TO STAY SAFE WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE THREATENS</h3>
                    <h4>Prepare NOW</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn how to secure heavy furniture and appliances to the walls to prevent tipping.</li>
                        <li>Identify safe spots in each room, such as under sturdy tables or against inside walls.</li>
                        <li>Develop a family emergency plan that includes meeting places and communication methods.</li>
                        <li>Have an emergency kit prepared with food, water, medical supplies, and important documents.</li>
                        <li>Sign up for your communityâ€™s alert system for earthquake warnings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Survive DURING</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you are indoors, stay there. Drop, Cover, and Hold On until the shaking stops.</li>
                        <li>If you are outdoors, move to an open area away from buildings, trees, and utility wires.</li>
                        <li>If you are in a vehicle, stop in a clear area and stay inside until the shaking stops.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Be Safe AFTER</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check yourself and others for injuries and provide first aid as necessary.</li>
                        <li>Listen to local news and authorities for information about safety and emergency assistance.</li>
                        <li>Expect aftershocks. They can happen minutes, days, or even weeks after the initial quake.</li>
                        <li>Be cautious when entering damaged buildings and be aware of potential hazards.</li>
                        <li>Document property damage with photographs for insurance claims.</li>
                        <li>Use text messages or social media to communicate with family and friends to avoid overloading phone systems.</li>
                    </ul>
